Learn Reverse Engineering
---------------------------
I started [this](https://github.com/ItzG3b/Learn-Reverse-Engineering) Github repo to attempt to help more people learn reverse engineering, patching, and assembly.

Currently the project only has two programs, a simple C "Hello-World" program, and a slightly more complex (but still easy, it took me like 10 minutes to make the whole thing) Windows "Crack-Me".

If you want to contribute to the project simply create a pull request! Expect 1-2 updates a week.
