ROP Level 4 Overview
---------------------------

Full code is avalible [here](https://ghostbin.com/paste/zgkmn).

This writeup aims to have a text-based overview of Billy Ellis's ROPLevel4 exploit.

Lets take it line by line (int by int?).

On lines 19-20 we see the code:

    int fixedAddr = 0xc03c;`
    int secretAddr = 0xbd28;

those are the original unmodified static offsets that you can find by just dropping the binary in radare2, IDA PRO, or Hopper, but those is key to calculating the new adresses after ASLR.

Line 24 we see

    char exploit[128];
    
that will be used to hold the payload later.

Line 28 we see 

    char string[64] = {0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41};
    
a string of junk "a" chars to be used a padding.

Line 32 we see

    char readData[16];
    
that will be used to hold the leaked adress.

to be continued....
