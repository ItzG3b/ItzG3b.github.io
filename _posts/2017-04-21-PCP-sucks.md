PCP Sucks, Don't Use It
---------------------------

No, this post isn't about PGP, Pretty Good Privacy, which happens to be good but rather PCP, Pretty Crappy Privacy, a horrible encryption method devised by me and [@ArtikusHG](https://twitter.com/ArtikusHG). It consists of two JavaScript functions, one encrypting your text with an easily reversible method and the other decrypting the message which is just as easy to reverse. It was fun to make, it may be fun/annoying to send to your friends but not good for important messages. Use PGP for that.
